- **Focus**: Consistent effort with good breathing control

## Week 4: Steady-State Development
- **Sessions**: 4 sessions
- **Duration**: 25-30 minutes
- **Format**:
  - 5-minute warm-up (16-18 SPM)
  - 15-20 minutes steady rowing (18-20 SPM)
  - 5-minute cool-down (14-16 SPM)
- **Target Heart Rate**: Keep below 160 BPM
- **Focus**: Maintaining comfortable pace with good form

## Pre-Rowing Warm-Up & Stretches (7-10 minutes)

### Gentle Mobility (3 minutes)
- Cat-Cow: 8-10 slow reps
- Pelvic Tilts: 10-12 reps
- Gentle Torso Rotations: 8-10 each side

### Core Activation (2-3 minutes)
- Dead Bug: 8-10 each side
- Bird Dog: 8-10 each side
- Glute Bridges: 10-12 reps

### Key Stretches (2-3 minutes)
- Child's Pose: 45 seconds

- Piriformis Stretch: 30-45 seconds each side
- Child's Pose: 1-2 minutes
- Gentle Spinal Twist: 30-45 seconds each side

## Back Protection & Safety Tips
- **Heart Rate Management**: If heart rate exceeds 160 BPM, reduce intensity or take a break
- **Proper Form**: Legs → Back → Arms (drive); Arms → Back → Legs (recovery)
- **Power Source**: Drive primarily through legs (60-70% of power), not your back
- **Finish Position**: Avoid excessive layback (only to 11 o'clock position)
- **Core Engagement**: Brace core before initiating each stroke
- **Recovery Phase**: Keep it slow and controlled (this should be the "rest" part of your stroke)
- **Stroke Rate**: Keep lower than you might think (14-20 SPM to start) with emphasis on form
- **Breathing**: Establish a breathing rhythm (exhale during drive, inhale during recovery)
- **Hydration**: Drink water before, during and after your session
- **Listen to Your Body**: Stop immediately if you feel back pain or excessive fatigue
- **Cool-down**: Never skip your cool-down period or post-workout stretches

## Signs to Stop Rowing Immediately
- Sharp back pain or spasms
- Dizziness or light-headedness
- Heart rate that won't come down below 170 BPM
- Unusual shortness of breath
- Inability to maintain proper form due to fatigue
